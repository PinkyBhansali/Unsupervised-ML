## Project Title: (E-commerce Clustering Project Using RMF Approach)[]

## Description:
- This project aims to enhance the customer segmentation strategy for an e-commerce site through the implementation of the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis approach.
- The RMF approach involves evaluating customer behavior based on three key factors: recency of purchase, frequency of transactions, and monetary value of purchases.

Objective:
The primary objective is to cluster customers into distinct groups to optimize marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and overall customer experience.
By leveraging RMF metrics, we aim to identify high-value customer segments, re-engage dormant customers, and tailor marketing efforts for improved customer retention and satisfaction.
